## My process

### Built with

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A styling framework
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

This was the first challenge I finished. And I am currently learning TailwindCss, so going forward I would be doing all challenges using that only. So, I can get better at using it. And I am not used to make mobileFirst approach, so yeah that is also something that I want to improve with this challanges.
